								Hi!
							</p>
								I am A Rohit, a 27 year old visual designer based in Bangalore. I am an Electronics and Communication Engineer from NIT (National Institute of Technology, Karnataka) and a post graduate from NID ( National Institute of Design, Paldi ) specialising in Animation and Film Design.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am an introvert who likes to observe the world around and I believe thatâ€™s what inspires my storytelling. With a combination of logical and creative mind, my design is what I think, see, feel, hear and smell.
							</p>

							<p>
								P.s - Love Football, Chess and am quite good at it. Also a hardcore nature lover.
